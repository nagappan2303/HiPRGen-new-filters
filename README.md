This repository introduces additional filters for HiPRGen, focusing on more effective reaction filtering. The default star-count method in HiPRGen often fails because not all atoms in a reaction are unique. Ideally, HiPRGen should remove reactions that either involve the simultaneous breaking or forming of more than two bonds, or are break-1-form-1 reactions where the reaction center is not shared between the bond breaking and formation steps, as such reactions are unlikely to occur in a single concerted step.

To address this, we integrate the AAM-Ising repository, which performs fast and efficient atom-to-atom mapping for the main chain atoms (C, O, Na, S, etc., but excluding H). On top of this, we have added new functions in additional_filters.py to better implement the intended filtering in HiPRGen.
